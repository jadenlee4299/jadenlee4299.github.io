            <h1>Defeated Some Giants!</h1>
            <p><em>March 25, 1601, at the Ninth Hour - The Plains</em></p>
            <p>I didn't expect to find them out in the wild so it was fasinating to see them.</p>
            <p>With my trusty steed I was able to prevail upon it.</p>
            <p>Though everyone around claimed it to be amere windmill I knew what it truly was.</p>
            <p>Disguised from everyone I know the truth and it is up to me to defeat it.</p>

            <h1>Rescued a Damsel in Distress</h1>
            <p><em>April 13, 1601, at the Eleventh Hour - The Wooded Glade</em></p>
            <p>Today, as the sun shined through the land and descended to the hills, I ventured into a dense forest.</p>
            <p>Admist the haunted spirit and hidden beasts I found a maiden in distress bounded by invisible chains</p>
            <p>And so with my sturdy partner Rocinante I broke the unseen bonds that held her.</p>
            <p>However, the maiden seems to be under a spell as she gave no thanks and just vanished.</p>

            <h1>Faced against the trials given by the Enchanted Inn</h1>
            <p><em>June 18, 1601, at the Eighth Hour - By the Crossroads Inn</em></p>
            <p>After my long journey I found myself at an inn standing by itself by the crossroads.</p>
            <p>As soon as I stepped foot inside I sensed it was no ordinary tavern but a den of illusion</p>
            <p>The wicked wizard who disguised himself as an innkeeper demanded gold for the simplest of hospitality.</p>
            <p>And while there were many temptations by strong will kept me away from falling ill.</p>
